All local variables should be initiadated by the developers.
Local variables are method scoped.
While instance(class scoped) and static(class scoped with static keyword) will be initialized by the compiler based on the dt.

Array starts with index 0.
int[] a= new int[10];
int[] a= new int{10,20,30}
String[] s= new String[10];
String[]s1= new String["Rose","lily"]
